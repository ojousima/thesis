\section{Conclusions}
In this paper the operation environment of tyre has been presented, and reasonable choises for energy harvesting technology have been identified. Both Piezoelectric and electromagnetic methods have been researched. While both methods can produce similar AC-power levels to resistive load, electromagnetic harvesting was found to produce too low voltage for rectification and operation of microcontroller. 

Various voltage doubling and active rectification schemes do exist, as well as boost converters and charge pumps which could be used to bring voltage from electromagnetic harvesting to usable levels. However, piezoelectronic harvester does not require such extra complexity. 

Future work is needed on determining which factors limit the voltage output of electromagnetic harvester below the simulated results as well as to create maximum power point tracking for both methods.
