\section{Results}

\subsection{Validation of harvester model}
A Simulink model was built to verify feasibility of the linear generator. The simulation included real acceleration data from previous studies made by {\color{red} cite} and a model of generator as well as a simplified capacitive-resistive load. There is an abundance of previous work done on simulating linear generators  {\color{red} cite}, however a simplified model was used at this stage to get a proof-of-concept level generator. Further work remains in optimizing the design in terms of size, mass, power output, usable speed range, cost and long-term reliability.
