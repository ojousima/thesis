abstract = {Piezoelectric materials can be used as mechanisms to transfer mechanical energy, usually ambient vibration, into electrical energy that can be stored and used to power other devices. With the recent advances in wireless and MEMS technology, sensors can be placed in exotic and remote locations. Since these devices are wireless it becomes necessary that they have their own power supply. The power supply in most cases is the conventional battery; however, problems can occur when using batteries because of their finite life span. Because most sensors are being developed so that they can be placed in remote locations such as structural sensors on a bridge or GPS tracking devices on animals in the wild, obtaining the sensor simply to replace the battery can become a very expensive task. Furthermore, in the case of sensors located on civil structures it is often advantageous to embed them, making access impossible. Therefore, if a method of obtaining the untapped energy surrounding these sensors was implemented, significant life could be added to the power supply. One method is to use piezoelectric materials to obtain ambient energy surrounding the test specimen. This captured energy could then be used to prolong the life of the power supply or in the ideal case provide endless energy for the sensors lifespan. The goal of this study is to develop a model of the piezoelectric power harvesting device. This model would simplify the design procedure necessary for determining the appropriate size and vibration levels necessary for sufficient energy to be produced and supplied to the electronic devices. An experimental verification of the model is also performed to ensure its accuracy. 2},

abstract = {Extracting energy from ambient vibration to power wireless sensor nodes has been an attractive area of research, particularly in the automotive monitoring field. This article reports the design, analysis and testing of a vibration energy harvesting device based on a miniature asymmetric air-spaced cantilever. The developed design offers high power density, and delivers electric power that is sufficient to support most wireless sensor nodes for structural health monitoring (SHM) applications. The optimized design underwent three evolutionary steps, starting from a simple cantilever design, going through an air-spaced cantilever, and ending up with an optimized air-spaced geometry with boosted power density level. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) was used as an initial tool to compare the three geometries' stiffness (K), output open-circuit voltage (V(ave)), and average normal strain in the piezoelectric transducer ($\epsilon$(ave)) that directly affect its output voltage. Experimental tests were also carried out in order to examine the energy harvesting level in each of the three designs. The experimental results show how to boost the power output level in a thin air-spaced cantilever beam for energy within the same space envelope. The developed thin air-spaced cantilever (8.37 cm3), has a maximum power output of 2.05 mW (H = 29.29 $\mu$J/cycle).},

@article{Erturk2009,
abstract = {Vibration-based energy harvesting has been investigated by several researchers over the last decade. The ultimate goal in this research field is to power small electronic components (such as wireless sensors) by using the vibration energy available in their environment. Among the basic transduction mechanisms that can be used for vibration-to-electricity conversion, piezoelectric transduction has received the most attention in the literature. Piezoelectric materials are preferred in energy harvesting due to their large power densities and ease of application. Typically, piezoelectric energy harvesters are cantilevered structures with piezoceramic layers that generate alternating voltage output due to base excitation. This work presents distributed-parameter electromechanical models that can accurately predict the coupled dynamics of piezoelectric energy harvesters. First the issues in the existing models are addressed and the lumped-parameter electromechanical formulation is corrected by introducing a dimensionless correction factor derived from the distributed-parameter solution. Then the electromechanically coupled closed-form analytical solution is obtained based on the thin-beam theory since piezoelectric energy harvesters are typically thin structures. The multi-mode expressions obtained from the analytical solution are reduced to single-mode expressions for modal vibrations. The analytical solutions for voltage response and vibration response are validated experimentally for various cases. The single-mode analytical equations are then used for deriving closed-form relations for parameter identification and optimization. Asymptotic analyses of the electromechanical frequency response functions are given along with expressions for the short-circuit and the open-circuit resonance frequencies. A simple experimental technique is presented to identify the optimum load resistance using only a single resistor and an open-circuit voltage measurement. A case study is given to compare the power generation performances of iii commonly used monolithic piezoceramics and novel single crystals with a focus on the effects of plane-stress material constants and mechanical damping. The effects of strain nodes and electrode configuration on piezoelectric energy harvesting are discussed theoretically and demonstrated experimentally. An approximate the assumed-modes method is presented and it can be used for modeling of asymmetric and moderately thick energy harvester configurations. Finally, a piezo-magneto-elastic energy harvester is introduced as a non-conventional broadband energy harvester.},

Second, mechanical resonance frequency and load resistance are optimized regarding maximum output power using lumped-parameter simulations and measured acceleration data from human walking motion. When worn on the body during walking, the optimized generator has an output power of 2-25 $\mu$ W, depending on its position on the human body. Stator and translator occupy a volume of 0.25 cm3.

This article starts with an historical review of pneumatic tyre development and demonstrates the reasons and explains the need for using a tyre condition monitoring system. Following this, different tyre pressure measurement approaches are compared in order to determine what type of pressure sensor is best to consider in the research proposal plan. Then possible energy harvesting means inside land vehicle pneumatic tyres are reviewed. Following this, state of the art battery-less tyre pressure monitoring systems developed by individual researchers or by world leading tyre manufacturers are presented.

The evolution of the normalized harvested power is theoretically studied as a function of these parameters. Experimental results and a bibliographic study present typical orders of magnitude of coupling and losses coefficients values for piezoelectric and electromagnetic generators, and put forward unusual dualities: while piezoelectric generators have low coupling and low losses coefficients, electromagnetic generators exhibit high resistive losses compensated by high coupling coefficients. For both generators almost the same normalized power can be harvested with these dual parameters. Finally, the scaling effect is investigated: it is notably shown that the power density of an electromagnetic generator does not decrease proportionately with its volume as it is commonly accepted. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Nowadays, harvesting energy from vibration is one of the most promising technologies. However, the majority of cur- rent researches obtain 10 mWto 100 mW power, which has only limited applications in self-powered wireless sensors and low-power electronics. In fact, the vibrations in some situations can be very large, for example, the vibrations of tall buildings, long bridges, vehicle systems, railroads, ocean waves, and even human motions. With the global concern on energy and environmental issues, energy harvesting from large-scale vibrations is more attractive and becomes a research frontier. This article is to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art on the large-scale vibration energy harvesting, ranging from 1 W to 100 kW or more. Subtopics include energy assessment from large vibrations, piezoelectric materials and electromagnetic transducers, motion transmission and magnification mechanisms, power electronics, and vibration control. The relevant applications discussed in this article include vibration energy har- vesting from human motion, vehicles, transportations, and civil structures. The unique challenges and future research directions of large-scale vibration energy harvesting are also discussed},

Most vibration-based converters generate the maximum power only when the generator is excited at its resonance frequency. To overcome this limitation, researchers focus on strategies for increasing the working bandwidth of an energy harvester. Due to the amount of different approaches for broadband energy harvesting, we suggest a categorization. This review presents a classification of the current techniques. Every technique has its own benefits and drawbacks and is suitable for different applications. This review presents the categorization and describes each conversion technique. Typical research approaches are shown to get a better understanding of the energy harvesting techniques. The advantages and drawbacks are presented, and the suitability is shown for each category.},

abstract = {In traditional Permanent Magnet Machines, such as electric motors and generators, power is transmitted by magnetic flux passing through an air gap, which has a very low magnetic permeability, limiting performance. However, reducing the air gap through traditional means carries risks in manufacturing, with tight tolerances and associated costs, and reliability, with thermal and dynamic effects requiring adequate clearance. Using a magnetically permeable, high dielectric strength material has the potential to improve magnetic performance, while at the same time offering performance advantages in heat transfer. Ferrofluids were studied as a method for improved permeability in the rotor / stator gap with a combined experimental and computational approach. Results show promise for the ferrofluid technique. An off-the-shelf motor system showed improved performance with ferrofluids vs. fluids of equivalent viscosity, and improved performance vs. an air gap at low RPM. New generator designs showed design dependent performance gains, although some potential for negative performance effects. A proof of concept generator was built and tested, with increased voltage vs. RPM predicted through virtual prototyping, and validated through experimentation, showing \~{}10\% improvement on voltage vs. RPM at the <600 RPM range. More repeatable engineering tests demonstrated a \~{}30\% increase in the voltage / RPM relationship for designs with an isolated stator chamber and a large stator – rotor gap. However, the effects were negative for a similar system with a small stator-rotor gap due to leakage flux effects.},

abstract = {Charges induced in triboelectric process are usually referred as a negative effect either in scientific research or technological applications, and they are wasted energy in many cases. Here, we demonstrate a simple, low cost and effective approach of using the charging process in friction to convert mechanical energy into electric power for driving small electronics. The triboelectric generator (TEG) is fabricated by stacking two polymer sheets made of materials having distinctly different triboelectric characteristics, with metal films deposited on the top and bottom of the assembled structure. Once subjected to mechanical deformation, a friction between the two films, owing to the nano-scale surface roughness, generates equal amount but opposite signs of charges at two sides. Thus, a triboelectric potential layer is formed at the interface region, which serves as a charge "pump" for driving the flow of electrons in the external load if there is a variation in the capacitance of the system. Such a flexible polymer TEG gives an output voltage of up to 3.3V at a power density of \~{}10.4mW/cm 
                        3.

Most research is focused on a particular technology, and it is often difficult to compare widely differing designs and approaches to vibration-based energy harvesting. The aim of this study is to provide a general theory that can be used to compare different approaches and designs for vibration-based generators. Estimates of maximum theoretical power density based on a range of commonly occurring vibrations, measured by the author, are presented. Estimates range from 0.5 to 100mW/cm 3for vibrations in the range of 1–10 m/s 2at 50–350 Hz. The theory indicates that, in addition to the parameters of the input vibrations, power output depends on the system coupling coefficient, the quality factor of the device, the mass density of the generator, and the degree to which the electrical load maximizes power transmission. An expression for effectiveness that incorporates all of these factors is developed. The general theory is applied to electromagnetic, piezoelectric, magnetostrictive, and electrostatic transducer technologies. Finally, predictions from the general theory are compared to experimental results from two piezoelectric vibration generator designs.},

Systems can scavenge power from human activity or derive limited energy from ambient heat, light, radio, or vibrations. Ongoing power management developments enable battery-powered electronics to live longer. Such advances include dynamic optimization of voltage and clock rate, hybrid analog-digital designs, and clever wake-up procedures that keep the electronics mostly inactive. Exploiting renewable energy resources in the device's environment, however, offers a power source limited by the device's physical survival rather than an adjunct energy store. Energy harvesting's true legacy dates to the water wheel and windmill, and credible approaches that scavenge energy from waste heat or vibration have been around for many decades. Nonetheless, the field has encountered renewed interest as low-power electronics, wireless standards, and miniaturization conspire to populate the world with sensor networks and mobile devices.

abstract = {A parameterized model for the impact dynamics of a piezoelectric microactuator is proposed, and a system-identification procedure for quantifying model parameters is presented. The proposed model incorporates squeeze-film damping, adhesion and coefficient-of-restitution effects. Following parameter quantification from sample data of bouncing impacts and progressive ramped-square-wave inputs, the model is found to be effective in predicting the time response of the actuator to a range of square-wave and sinusoidal inputs. The main contributions of this paper are to show that the dynamic response to micro-scale contact can be predicted using simple lumped-parameter modeling after a proposed system-identification procedure is performed and that certain small-scale forces can be quantified. For example, for motions where bounce of the cantilever tip may occur, the range of adhesion is found to be time dependent and vary between approximately 20 and 520 nN, while the range of squeeze-film damping is estimated to be between 50 and 130 nN, depending on the input signal frequency and amplitude. The presence, absence and quantity of bounces upon impact are predicted very accurately, while oscillation amplitudes and contact durations are predicted to be between 1\% and 30\% error for the majority of many test cases of periodic inputs between 5 and 100 Hz.},

abstract = {This article proposes to harvest solar micro-energy using the pyroelectric effect and low wind flow. The basic concept was presented and validated by laboratory experiments with controlled airflow. The measured temperature variation, subject to the intensity of radiation and wind speed in the environment was demonstrated to reach 16 °C. The time variation of temperature was 0.53 °C s-1 with the speed of airflow at 2 ms-1. The power density with PZT as the pyroelectric material was 4.2 $\mu$W cm-3 in laboratory conditions. Both the thermodynamic model and electric model of the pyroelectric generator were established, and a numerical procedure was developed to predict the system performance which was proven to be reliable. The characteristics of such an energy harvesting system were analyzed in detail by simulation, and the results indicated that the proposed idea is promising. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.
