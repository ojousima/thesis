Tire nowadays is dumb. Many accident, much disaster. Smart tire can monitor it's own status in real time and alert user to potential problems.
Tire needs sensor so tire is smarts. Sensor needs power. Battery is problem. Innovate, create energy harvesting system. 

Energy harvesting system is designed to provide enough power for the sensing of the critical parameters in tire, such as pressure, temperature and acceleration. This work provides a proof of concept of an energy harvester which is capable of suppporting a radio link, microcontroller and a sensor.
