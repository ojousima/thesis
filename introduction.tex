Tire nowadays is dumb. Many accident, much disaster. Smart tire can monitor it's own status in real time and alert user to potential problems.
Tire needs sensor so tire is smarts. Sensor needs power. Battery is problem. Innovate, create energy harvesting system. 

Energy harvesting system is designed to provide enough power for the sensing of the critical parameters in tire, such as pressure, temperature and acceleration. This work provides a proof of concept of an energy harvester which is capable of suppporting a radio link, microcontroller and a sensor. 

Second section of this work details the background and previous work done on sensors of a tire. Third section presents the theoretical work and design of energy harvester as well as theoretical estimates for efficiency of system. Fourth section presents the experimental results from building the system. Conclusions are presented in the fifth section.
